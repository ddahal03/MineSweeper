# MineSweeper

## I misnamed the proejct

# What is the program?
* Uses Java to create a Minesweeper game that's playable in the terminal
* You can use the number clues to solve the game by opening all of the safe squares.
* You can choose from three different levels (B)eginning, (I)ntermediate, and (A)dvance and this changes the matrix from 5 by 5 to 10 by 10 based on your choice.
  

# Concepts used
* To create this game I used inheritance like has-a and is-a relationship.

# Future Work
* Maybe use other features of Java to add visuals for the game.
